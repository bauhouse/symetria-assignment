# Symetria Front End Development Assignment

The assets provided are:

- A screenshot
- Some SVG files for the cryptocurrency icons
- A javascript file

The test is to implement the area outlined in the red square on the screenshot.

In the Javascript file, you’ll find some definitions for Wallet & ExchangeRate, an array of ExchangeRatesToCAD, and a GetWallets() function.  GetWallets() simulates a server call and will succeed 4 out of 5 times, returning wallet data.  That wallet data, combined with the exchange rates, is enough to mock up this screenshot.

For clarity, here’s an explanation of the top wallet components.  “0.5001 BTC” is the amount of cryptocurrency.  “C$10,000.10” is an amount of currency converted to Canadian dollars (CAD).  The green up arrow with “+C$1,000.77” means the value today has increased by that amount.  The amount below it (C$10,000.10) is a duplicate of the value on the left – it’s an older design and doesn’t make sense, but it can be mocked up as it is.

The mock should be responsive and look appropriate on desktop or mobile.

An animation should be used.  One suggestion is to only show the total portfolio value at first, then once it’s clicked, the other values appear.

It would be ideal if Vue.js were used.

Since we expect the test to take some time we’d be happy to send $100 in Bitcoin on completion.

Please give us a rough ETA once you had a look at the scope...
